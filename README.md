## ‚ú® Features

### üì± Mobile Application (for Users)
- **Live Map & Theming:** Displays all nearby charging stations on an interactive Google Map with custom, theme-aware dark and light styles.
- **Real-Time Status:** View charger availability at a glance with dynamic, color-coded markers that update in real-time for all users.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly find stations by name and filter the map to show only currently available chargers.
- **Turn-by-Turn Directions:** Integrates with the phone's native maps app to provide navigation directly to a selected charging station.
- **User-Generated Content:**
  - **Station Submissions:** Users can submit new, unlisted charging stations for admin approval.
  - **Reviews & Ratings:** Leave a star rating and a text comment for any station, helping other users make informed decisions.
- **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure login/registration system powered by Firebase Authentication. Users can manage their profile and vehicle information.
- **Social System:** A complete friends system with user search, friend requests, a friends list, and the ability to remove friends.

### üåê Web Admin Panel (for Administrators)
- **Secure Admin Portal:** A separate web application with a login screen that only grants access to users with admin privileges.
- **Station Moderation Queue:** A dashboard to review, approve, or decline new charging stations submitted by users. Approved stations instantly appear on the mobile app map.
- **Full CRUD Management:**
  - **Stations:** Create, read, update, and delete live charging station data directly.
  - **Users:** View all registered users, manage their profiles, and grant/revoke admin privileges or disable accounts.
  - **Reviews:** View a centralized list of all reviews across all stations and delete inappropriate or spam content.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development & CI/CD
- **Automated Workflow:** A GitHub Actions pipeline automatically checks code formatting, runs static analysis, and builds the Android app on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project contains two applications: the main mobile app and a web admin panel.

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Version 3.16+)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/EV-Charger-Finder.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd EV-Charger-Finder
    ```

3.  **Install packages:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase:**
    - Follow the [FlutterFire CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to connect your Firebase project. This command will configure both the Android and Web apps.
    ```sh
    flutterfire configure
    ```

5.  **Set Up Admin User:**
    - In your Firestore `users` collection, find the user document for the account you want to be an admin.
    - Add a new field: `isAdmin` (Type: `boolean`) and set its value to `true`.

6.  **Add your Google Maps API Key:**
    - Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and replace the placeholder with your API key.

7.  **Run the Mobile App**
    This will use the default `lib/main.dart` entry point.
    ```sh
    flutter run

8. **Run the WebAdminPanel**
    ```sh
    flutter run -d chrome --target=lib/main_web.dart
